            <p class="left-border"><b>PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND</b><br>
                I have spent much of my career working as a Landscape Architect - first as a designer, then credentialed professional, and finally as a project manager. 
                During that time I, had the chance to work on nearly every construction project type imaginable while gaining highly transferable skills. 
                I have five years of direct project management experience with large and small projects, in both domestic and international settings.  
                The more I have advanced in my career, the more I appreciate the intricacies of well-run projects and collaborative team environments.  
                There is a true art to executing projects that stay on schedule and within budget; it is a skill I aim to continue mastering through training and education.</p>

        <p><b>TECH TRAINING</b><br>  
            In 2022 I attended a coding bootcamp that covered computer science fundamentals and full-stack web development.  
            The program focused on the Python coding language as used in data analysis and development, including NumPy, Pandas, and the Flask framework as used with PostgreSQL.
