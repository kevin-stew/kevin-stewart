        <p><b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
        I’m new to tech!  After contemplating a career change since 2019(ish), I finally took the plunge and began teaching myself Python beginning in November 2021.  I later enrolled in a coding bootcamp during the first quarter of 2022, and after successfully completing it, have since been working on my own projects and looking for my first tech job.  Because my training was full-stack, I have continued learning advanced techniques with the stack covered during my bootcamp, and have made several projects with it since.  In addition to project work I enjoy learning new languages and tools, thinking up new app ideas, and turning vision into reality. I geek out on system diagraming, and have spent hours adjusting Entity Relationship Diagrams tailored to specific business models - it’s fun!</p>

        <p><b>PREVIOUS WORK EXPERIENCE</b><br>
            Prior to entering tech I spent over eight years working as a Landscape Architect; first as a designer, then licensed professional, and finally as a project manager.  During that experience I had the chance to work on nearly every project type imaginable while gaining valuable skills that are transferable to any type of project work.  I have project management experience and have worked in both domestic and international settings (US, Germany, Saudi Arabia), with teammates and clients from around the world.  The projects I oversaw were complicated and required the coordination of many disciplines having overlapping scopes; over time I became an expert in negotiating the ambiguous zone where responsibilities overlap (and sometimes conflict).  The skills I bring with me from architectural design have so far proven to be relevant in tech, and I look forward to expanding them as my professional journey continues to evolve.

        <p><b>WHY PIVOT INTO TECH?</b><br>  
            In a word: <i>growth</i>.  While part of me will forever be a landscape architect at heart, the growth and opportunity available in the technology sector is unrivaled to that of any other, and with some effort and continued learning it's very accessible. After contemplating a career switch and watching numerous colleges make the switch over the years, I finally got my nerve together and took the plunge when I had the chance.

        <p><b>TECH TRAINING</b><br>  
            Between January and March of 2022 I attended a full time coding bootcamp with <a href="https://codingtemple.com/full-time-python-bootcamp/" target="_blank" class="normalLink">Coding Temple</a>. Their program provided comprehensive training in the fundamentals of computer science and full-stack web development.  Since completing the program I have continued to self-teach and further my understanding of software engineering.

        <p><b>FORMAL SCHOOLING</b><br>  
            I have a Bachelor’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning and Master’s in Landscape Architecture from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
