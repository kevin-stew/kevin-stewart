        <p><b>MY DEVELOPER JOURNEY</b><br>
            I started learning to code and web-development skills in the late-pandemic era as a way to challenge myself 
            and automate some of the most tedious tasks I found myself doing at work. 
            Eventually I enrolled in a coding bootcamp to accelerate the pace of learning and rapidly expand my horizons. 
            After successfully completing that training, I have continued to work on web-apps while also gaining experience 
            in new languages and frameworks. I enjoy thinking about how to improve efficiencies in any process, 
            how aspects of architectural design can be automated with web technologies, and turning vision into reality.</p>

        <p><b>WHY TECH?</b><br>  
            In a word: growth. The growth and opportunity available in the tech sector are unrivaled to any other, 
            and with some effort and continued learning it is very accessible. Also, and importantly, I find it very interesting. 
            Because technology has become so integrated into daily life, its influence has an outsized effect on 
            our lived experiences. In the same way I aspired to improve the world through better spatial design, 
            I believe even more potential exists to improve the world, and our day-to-day experiences, through better technology. 
            At the onset of Web 3.0 and a wave of industry disrupting innovations, there is perhaps no better time to 
            join this change and contribute to it.

        <p><b>LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE EXPERIENCE</b><br>
            I have spent the majority of my career (nearly a decade) working as a Landscape Architect; 
            first as a designer, then credentialed professional, and finally as a project manager. 
            During that time I had the chance to work on nearly every project type imaginable while gaining valuable skills 
            that are highly transferable. I have project management experience and have worked 
            in both domestic and international settings; the projects I oversaw were complicated and required the coordination 
            of many disciplines with overlapping scopes.

        <p><b>TECH TRAINING</b><br>  
            In early 2022 I attended a full-time coding bootcamp with. 
            Their program provided comprehensive training in the fundamentals of computer science and full-stack web development.
