    <p class="mb-4">SVG files offer the ability to generate crisp, customized, vector graphics using lines of code paired with data sources.  Despite a career that involved a lot of visual production, I have only recently learned about this novel file type and interactive capabilities.  Below are some initial experiments.

    <p>These interactive population maps were made using Python, Pygal, and a static Json data source.

    <p>This exhibit of the top-30 most popular Python-based GitHub repositories was made using Python, Pygal, and GitHubâ€™s API.  Repos were generated based on the amount of stars awarded by other site users, and hovering over a project bar links directly to the project repo.  Next steps with this exhibit will be to have it auto generated using real-time data each time this page is opened.
